Q:Difference between ZRS and GZRS? 
A: ZRS:Zone redundancy storage
   data stored as 3 replica in available datacenters under one region.
   GZRS:Geo zone redundancy storage
   data stored as 3 replica in available datacenters just like ZRS & also available in secondary region and will be accessible only if primary region fails.
   To access the secondary region we have to use RA-GZRS[read access-geo zone redundancy storage].
